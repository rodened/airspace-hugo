Flows can be then deployed to the runtime in a single-click.\nJavaScript functions can be created within the editor using a rich text editor.\nA built-in library allows you to save useful functions, templates or flows for re-use.\nBuilt on Node.js\nThe light-weight runtime is built on Node.js, taking full advantage of its event-driven, non-blocking model. This makes it ideal to run at the edge of the network on low-cost hardware such as the Raspberry Pi as well as in the cloud.\nWith over 225,000 modules in Node&#39;s package repository, it is easy to extend the range of palette nodes to add new capabilities.\nSocial Development\nThe flows created in Node-RED are stored using JSON which can be easily imported and exported for sharing with others.\nAn online flow library allows you to share your best flows with the world.\nGet Started\nNode-RED is built on Node.js, taking full advantage of its event-driven, non-blocking model.
